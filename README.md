A backend application built with Spring Boot for managing expenses, architected using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) to ensure clean separation between business logic and external dependencies. It features a secure REST API with JWT-based authentication, role-based access control (USER and ADMIN), and a modular design that enhances maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* Secure Authentication: Stateless authentication flow using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* Role-Based Authorization: Clear distinction between USER and ADMIN roles, with endpoints protected using method-level security.
* User Management: Endpoints for user registration, login, and self-updating of data.
* Admin Module: A dedicated set of endpoints for administrators to manage all users, including deletion and role changes.
* API Documentation: Integrated Swagger UI for easy exploration and testing of all API endpoints.
* Clean Architecture: Follows best practices with a clear separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Repositories).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* Framework: Spring Boot 3
* Language: Java 21
* Security: Spring Security 6
* Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Database: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate (designed for PostgreSQL)
* Build Tool: Gradle
* API Documentation: SpringDoc / Swagger UI
* Mapping: MapStruct
* SonarQube as quality gate tool


## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Pattern

This structure follows Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters):

* adapters/ - Adapters layer (controllers, DTOs, configurations)
* application/ - Application layer (services, ports, exceptions)
* domain/ - Domain layer (entities, use cases, business logic)


## üìã Layer Responsibilities

* Adapters Layer
     * config/security/ - Security configurations and initialization
     * in/web/ - Controllers and DTOs (input)
     * out/ - Repository implementations (output)
* Application Layer
     * port/in/ - Service interfaces (input)
     * port/out/ - Repository interfaces (output)
     * exception/ - Exception handling
* Domain Layer
     * service/ - Business service implementations
     * use_case/ - Commands and use cases

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 21 or higher
* Gradle - Version 8.x or higher (The project includes the Gradle Wrapper, so you don't need to install it manually).
* PostgreSQL - A running instance of a PostgreSQL database. You can also use the docker-compose included.
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code.

Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:** https://github.com/Ch94Ca/infnet-javaSpringProject.git

2. **Make the Gradle Wrapper executable (This step is only needed once on Linux/macOS):**
```console
chmod +x ./gradlew
```

3. **Configure the application in .env file:**
```console
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/expense_manager_db
DB_USERNAME=user_dev
DB_PASSWORD=password_dev

# JWT Secret Key - IMPORTANT: Use a long, random, and secret string here!
# You can generate one at https://www.javainuse.com/jwtgenerator
JWT_SECRET_KEY=YjM0ZDYxOTllY2M3YjFlZDUxMGEzN2YwYzZlMGU4ZWYxYjE4ZWQzYjVlN2E1ZjFhNzE2YzRkMmI3ZTdmMjQ=

# Admin user credentials automatically generated on first run
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@mail.com
INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpass

# Sonar token for quality gate
# Access localhost:9000 and generate a token under my account > security > generate tokens
SONAR_TOKEN=sqa_e88228c6f1502f2a93e2fa24a97f0ec10c9080c1
```

4. **Run the docker-compose file in docker folder to start postgreSQL database and SonarQube:**
```console
docker-compose up -d
```

5. **Build the project:**
```console
# On Linux/macOS
./gradlew build

# On Windows
gradlew.bat build
```
     
6. **Run the application:**
```console
# On Linux/macOS
./gradlew bootRun

# On Windows
gradlew.bat bootRun
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

7. **Access API Documentation:**

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI to see all available endpoints and test them:
[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## üîê Security Model

The API is secured using JWT.

Register or Login: A user must first register via POST /api/auth/register or log in via POST /api/auth/login. A successful login returns a JWT.
Send Token: For all subsequent requests to protected endpoints, the client must include the JWT in the Authorization header.
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
Roles:

*   `ROLE_USER`: Can manage their own data.
*   `ROLE_ADMIN`: Can manage all users and system settings.

## üß™ Running Tests

Run the test suite:
```console
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests with coverage
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

## ‚ú® Quality Gate

The API uses SonarQube (included in the docker-compose file) as a quality gate tool for code analysis.

### Setup Instructions:

* Go to http://localhost:9000
* Login with default credentials:
     * Username: admin
     * Password: admin
* Generate a token: My Account > Security > Generate Tokens
* Add the token to your .env file as SONAR_TOKEN=your_token_here
* Run gradle clean build sonar to execute the quality gate analysis

The analysis will check code quality, coverage, and security vulnerabilities.
